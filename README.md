# Moveable Morphable Components

This is a Python package for doing Topology Optimisation using the Moveable Morphable Components (MMC) method (Guo et. al 2014).

Much of the code is adapted from the 2D-MMC 218-line MATLAB code from _An efficient and easy-to-extend Matlab code of the Moving Morphable Component (MMC) method for three-dimensional topology optimization_, Du et. al. 2022.
